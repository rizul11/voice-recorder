# ABOUT
The Speech-to-Text Converter is a web application built using React that allows users to convert spoken words from the microphone into text. It is a real-time speech recognition tool that can be used for various purposes, including transcribing spoken language and voice commands.

The application provides a user-friendly interface for capturing spoken words, displaying the transcribed text in real-time, and offering the following features:

Start/Stop Listening: Users can initiate the speech recognition process by clicking "Start Listening" and stop it by clicking "Stop Listening."
Real-time Transcription: As the user speaks into the microphone, the application transcribes the spoken words into text, which is displayed in a designated area.
Audio Playback: After stopping the listening process, the recorded audio is available for playback through the built-in audio player.
